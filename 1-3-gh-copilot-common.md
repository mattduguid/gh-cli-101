## prompt engineering

- Single
  - Always focus your prompt on a single, well-defined task or question. This clarity is crucial for eliciting accurate and useful responses from Copilot.
- Specific
  - Ensure that your instructions are explicit and detailed. Specificity leads to more applicable and precise code suggestions.
- Short
  - While being specific, keep prompts concise and to the point. This balance ensures clarity without overloading Copilot or complicating the interaction.
- Surround
  - Utilize descriptive filenames and keep related files open. This provides Copilot with rich context, leading to more tailored code suggestions.
